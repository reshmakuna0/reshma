problem: so many teenagers/freshers lacks motivations/loses interests easily in coding after specific time
 website/app/chrome extension that will automatically asks you to take breaks and shows some games at that time
online community forums to take breaks and discuss regarding projects
our app should tell them a notification for eye exerceise or tell them to strech body a bit and play some interactive ui things for brain refreshment
invest new tool to generate code to reduce time.
instead of time, take breaks based on checkpoints
while coding if we got any gaps or errors some animations pop up through chrome extension showing error in a funny way

Basics of Internet:
internet: network of networks
WWW-- Tim Berners Lee
How actually internet works?
client-server model:
  client request the server
  server responds to the client
every website also have protocol in URL
https://www.google.com  ---> URL
SSL -- secure socket layer

what is the difference between Google,
Google Chrome, Google.com?
Google -- search engine -- it release crawlers to search all websites for specifc keywords then it will give ranking and show accordingly
eg: duckduckgo,yahoo,bing,yandex, brave search, youtube search, baidu, naver, startpage
google chrome: browser -- browse,dinosaur game, history,passwods,storage,pdf,movies,multi tasking
Every browser will have their own browser engine eg: chrome- v8, firefox - spiderMonkey, edge-chakra
google.com --- website -- collection of web pages 

web development process:

   layout
UX:User Experience  -- how it feels
A website having nice colors, buttons and proper paddings and all

Frontend: HTML -- structure, 
CSS -- design/styling of web page
JS -- functioning of web page
